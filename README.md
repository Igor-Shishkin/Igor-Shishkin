My repositoryes:
1. Knowledge-checker: this application provides the opportunity to take Java tests on different topics and at different levels. It downloads a .json file containing tests from a given website and offers the user two types of training. Aren't you afraid to test your strength?
2. School database: this app allows the user to work with a student database.
3. CourseSDA: this is my work with the academy and at the same time my big cheat sheet.
4. PROSTO_JAVA: these are materials for my YouTube channel.
5. This app was inspired by the 'JUG Pozna≈Ñ' and 'Allegro Tech' conference. The purpose of the conference was to exercise TDD work and work in groups, but we trained on a small algorithm for the Game Of Life. I was so interested in this that I decided to create a visualization of the algorithm, where I can create the shapes myself and look at their transformation under the action of the algorithm.
