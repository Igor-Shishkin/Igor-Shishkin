My repositoryes:
1. [CRM-system](https://github.com/Igor-Shishkin/CRM-system) - the system provides all the tools for storing the necessary information, maintaining logs and promoting clients. Used technologies: Java (Spring Boot 3.15), Angular 16, mySQL.
2. [GitHub Repository Viewer App](https://github.com/Igor-Shishkin/GitHubRepositoryViewerApp) - by entering a GitHub username, you can retrieve basic information about all the repositories of that user. Technologies used: Spring Boot.
3. [AlgoAnalyzer](https://github.com/Igor-Shishkin/AlgoAnalyzer) - this project aims to provide insights into the time complexity and efficiency of different algorithms under various conditions. Results are exported to an Excel file
4. Knowledge-checker: this application provides the opportunity to take Java tests on different topics and at different levels. It downloads a .json file containing tests from a given website and offers the user two types of training. Aren't you afraid to test your strength?
5. [Game Of Life App](https://github.com/Igor-Shishkin/GameOfLife): This app was inspired by the 'JUG Pozna≈Ñ' and 'Allegro Tech' conference. The purpose of the conference was to exercise TDD work and work in groups, but we trained on a small algorithm for the Game Of Life. I was so interested in this that I decided to create a visualization of the algorithm, where I can create the shapes myself and look at their transformation under the action of the algorithm.
6. CourseSDA: this is my work with the academy and at the same time my big cheat sheet.
7. PROSTO_JAVA: these are materials for my YouTube channel.
8. School database: this app allows the user to work with a student database.
